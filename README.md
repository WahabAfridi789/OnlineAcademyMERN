## MERN Stack Project

This is a full-stack web application that uses the MERN stack, which is a combination of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The MERN stack provides a robust framework for building scalable web applications.

The project includes an admin interface that allows for various operations to be performed on the Teacher and Student modules. There is a reference between students and teachers, which makes it easy to manage both modules.

To get started with the project, you'll need to run the following command in the OnlineAcademyMERN directory:

```
npm install
```

Once you've installed the necessary dependencies, start the server by running:

```
node app.js
```

Then, navigate to the frontend directory and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

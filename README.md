# MERN Stack Project


This project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack. The MERN stack is a combination of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, which provides a robust framework for building scalable web applications. 

The project includes an admin interface that allows for various operations to be performed on the Teacher module and Students. There is a reference between students and teachers, which allows for easy management of both modules. 

The front-end of the application is developed using the React.js framework, which provides a modern and efficient user interface.
